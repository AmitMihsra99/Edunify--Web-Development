Summary: 
You will be designing mini-project using Next js and MySQL consisting of two pages: one page to 
input and store the data of schools, the other page to fetch and display the data of the schools. 

Page 1: addSchool.jsx 
Description: You have to create a form in next js (using react-hook-form) using which a user can 
enter and store the data of a school in the `schools` table. The form needs to have validation on 
inputs (for eg., email validation for email input) and also need to store the image of the school in a 
folder `schoolImages`. The form should be responsive (work on both phones and desktop).


Page 2: showSchools.jsx
Description: You have to create a page that shows the list of schools in the database in the way an 
ecommerce website shows products. Only the Schoolâ€™s name, address, city and image needs to be 
visible here.The page should be responsive 
(work on both phones and desktop).
